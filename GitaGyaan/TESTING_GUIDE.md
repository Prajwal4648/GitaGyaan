## 🎯 Comparison Test

### v1.0 vs v2.0

**Question**: "Who is Drona?"

**v1.0 Output** (What you DON'T want):
```
Based on the provided context from the Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1, 
Drona is identified in the following ways:
- He is addressed by Duryodhana as "my teacher"
- Duryodhana approaches him to discuss army formations
- Duryodhana lists him among his army's heroes
```

**v2.0 Output** (What you SHOULD get):
```
Drona, also known as Dronacharya, is the royal guru and master 
teacher of both the Pandavas and Kauravas. He is one of the 
greatest warriors and experts in archery and warfare in the 
Mahabharata, father of Ashwatthama. Despite teaching both sides, 
he fights on the Kaurava side in the battle of Kurukshetra.
