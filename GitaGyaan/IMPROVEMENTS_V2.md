## 🎯 Example Answer Improvements

### Question: "Who is Drona?"

**v1.0 Answer (Context-only):**
```
Based on the provided context from the Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1, 
Drona is identified in the following ways:
- He is addressed by Duryodhana as "my teacher" (Sloka 3)
- Duryodhana approaches him to discuss army formations (Sloka 2)
- Duryodhana lists him as one of his army's heroes (Sloka 8)
- Dhrishtadyumna, who arrayed the Pandava army, is Drona's 
  "intelligent disciple" (Sloka 3)
```

**v2.0 Answer (Intelligent):**
```
Drona, also known as Dronacharya, is the royal guru and master 
teacher of both the Pandavas and Kauravas. He is one of the 
greatest warriors and experts in archery and warfare in the 
Mahabharata. As mentioned in Chapter 1, Duryodhana addresses him 
as "my teacher" and lists him among the chief warriors of the 
Kaurava army. Despite being the teacher of both sides, Drona 
fights on the Kaurava side in the battle of Kurukshetra.
```

### Question: "Who is Sanjaya?"

**v2.0 Answer:**
```
Sanjaya is the minister and charioteer of King Dhritarashtra. He 
was granted divine vision by the sage Vyasa, which allows him to 
witness and narrate the events of the Kurukshetra battle from afar. 
In Chapter 1, he begins narrating the battlefield events to the 
blind king, describing how Duryodhana approached Drona after 
observing both armies assembled for war.
